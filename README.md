# Poetry by Benjamin Wade

This git repo contains poems that I, Benjamin Wade, have written. I thought this
was an interesting alternative to just keeping everything privately on my
computer or in a cloud service. I still have some stuff there, but I'm going to
try and put my public stuff (that I want to license in CC-BY) here.

I'm no great poet, either in terms of quality or quantity, but these words are
mine.
